# Automatic Number Plate Recognition (ANPR)

This is a project to build an automatic number plate recognition system using OpenCV, Python, and TensorFlow ML models. The system can detect license plates in images, segment characters on the plate, and recognize the characters using a trained ML model.

## Requirements
To run this project, you need to install the following libraries:

* OpenCV: `pip install opencv-python`
* TensorFlow: `pip install tensorflow`

# Usage
Clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/anpr.git
```

Collect license plate images and store them in the data folder. The images should be in JPEG or PNG format.
